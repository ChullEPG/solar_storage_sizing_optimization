All schedules are for penetration levels relative to the highest demand occuring on the
saturday, where it needs 76 electric vehicles to fulfil the need.

There are five text files (the filename is "{number of EVs made AVAILABLE},{number of ICE vehicles
USED}"), each with all the events of the day in it for each vehicle (the first vehicles are 
electric, last vehicles ICE).
The five files are for the five levels of penetration: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%.

Files noted with "electric vehicle(s) not used" means too many electric vehicles were
made available and some were simply not used.

Files noted with "electric vehicle(s) not used, but min ICE" means that there is a very low number
of electric vehicles that were made available that are not being used, but if the number of ICE
vehicles available were decreased by just 1 vehicle, some trips would be late even if all available
electric vehicles were to be used.
